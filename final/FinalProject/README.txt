Hi There! This project shifted a little bit from its original. What it does is basically to create a monthly Budget
where you can add accounts, incomes and expenses and add a budget to each of them. Basically, this is not but
a translation about what I do every month with my own budget. Write down how much I'll get, then discount 
how much I am going to spend during that month.


1- Accounts: You can create expenses or incomes. 
2- Month Budget: You would be able to create a month budget adding month and year. 
3- You can display accounts and the month budget.
4- you can save all and load all.
